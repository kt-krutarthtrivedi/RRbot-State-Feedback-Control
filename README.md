# RRbot-State-Feedback-Control

## Aim
The aim is to design a state feedback control law for the RRbot and perform set-point tracking. 

## Design Procedure
The control law is designed in MATLAB, and the parameters are tuned to achieve desirable state trajectories and control input trajectories. Once the results are satisfactory, further experiments are performed in Gazebo.

## Results

The implemented control law performed as expected to reach the setpoint within the given limited torque constraints. The state and control input trajectories are captured as follows:
